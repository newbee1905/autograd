# Autograd in C++

## About

This is my personal project helping me to understand machine learning and autograd by recreating it in cpp.

This is not recreating the wheel, since I will likely not use this for any real stuff, I will only use it for educational purpose.

## Build and Run

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
./bin/autograd
```
